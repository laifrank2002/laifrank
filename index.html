					<h2>Who are you?</h2>
					<p>Hullo! I'm Frank Lai (That's an f by the way), a student at Victoria Park Collegiate Institute, and I have really messy handwriting. I also program, but I'm guessing 
					from your squinting that you've noticed the former first.</p>
					<h2>So?</h2>
					<p>Anyways, since you came here, why not check out some of the things I do? I program in Turing, Javascript, and Java, but 
					Turing's the only one I've any experience in. If you have any questions, do contact me. Other than your teachers and classmates
					I'm probably the only other person who programs in this language.</p>
					<h2>Cool, what I should do now?</h2>
					<p>Snce you're here, why not check out my github? If you want to check out my social media, tough luck, I don't have any. But I do have an email. Maybe. Probably. 
					I should crawl out of my rock sometime this decade. </p>

					<a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/franklai" target="_blank"> DMOJ </a>
					<p>P.S, I also do some web design, but those people are a dime a dozen these days. If you want a good site, ask somebody else. But if you want a terrible site, I
					can get you covered in under three hours.</p>
